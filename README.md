# Document Processing

## Project Overview
This project explores various document processing techniques aimed at accurately identifying named entities and company logos within documents. Key components include:

- Logo Detection: A YOLOv8 model has been trained for the recognition of company logos. 
- Entity Detection and Recognition: To extract and interpret named entities from the documents, I've utilized the combination of PyTesseract and SpaCy. PyTesseract offers robust OCR capabilities to convert images into text, while SpaCy excels in named entity recognition (NER).


Currently, this project is in an exploratory phase. This initial exploratory project aims at efficiently extracting key information from a single document. As such, the methodologies and techniques applied here are subject to ongoing refinement and improvement. This will involve adapting and fine-tuning the existing model and techniques to accommodate different formats and layouts.
